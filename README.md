# Release Note
Note:
The chrome driver that I attach is only working for window and chrome version 80. In order to run the program properly, you must download chrome Driver according to your operating system and chrome version from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/

Also, make sure you bring that chromedriver inside of chromedriver folder and delete anything else in there. Only 1 chromedriver should be there.

Release Note:
- Now has window notifications
- Fix the bug where you don't hear the horn sound.
